                    <h3>MORTAL KOMBAT</h3>
                    <P>MOVIE SYNOPSIS</P>
    
                    <p>In "Mortal Kombat," MMA fighter Cole Young, accustomed to taking a beating for money, is unaware of his heritage--or why Out worldâ€™s Emperor Shang Tsung has sent his best warrior, Sub-Zero, an otherworldly Cryomancer, to hunt Cole down.
                       Fearing for his family's safety, Cole goes in search of Sonya Blade at the direction of Jax, a Special Forces Major who bears the same strange dragon marking Cole was born with.
                       Soon, he finds himself at the temple of Lord Raiden, an Elder God and the protector of Earth realm, who grants sanctuary to those who bear the mark.</p>
